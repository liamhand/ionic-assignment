This is my Calorie Counter App for the Mobile Applications Development project 2015.

My app has 3 states which correspond to my 3 html templates. These states are defined in my app.js file, and their controllers in my controllers.js file.

Upon starting my app, you are greeted by my home page. This contains a welcome image and some welcome text, and a link that you tap which brings you to the main section of the app.



## How to get this template
You can clone it using 'git clone <url>' where <url> is the ssh url on the right, or you can click "Download ZIP" on the right and start from there.
